Notes And Approach

The code simply handles the data from the JSON file and outputs it a ASCII Tree based Format.

Since the focus of the excercise was to output the given parameters as a tree, the program is designed to handle that particular scenario.

If one was to make a more robust program I would focus on creating a function that that would collect the JSON file name as its argument and parse the values into an array which would then run through each employee and their hires to arrange them in the ASCII format.
